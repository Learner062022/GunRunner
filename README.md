## Description
**GunRunner** is a fast-paced 3D run-and-gun arcade shooter set in a gritty sci-fi world. Inspired by genre-defining classic like **DOOM**, **Quake**, and **Half-Life**, it blends the relentless action of arcade-style combat with immersive environments and intelligent enemy behaviour.
